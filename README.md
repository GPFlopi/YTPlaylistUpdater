This code will update the playlist on your PC to match your playlist on YouTube!

Requirements:
1. A YouTube API key. (Temporary: I will remove this requirement later!)
2. A properly set up PATH to `yt-dlp.exe`, a downloader tool that can be acquired here: [yt-dlp GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

How to use:
1. Place the `youtubePlaylistUpdater.py` file in the folder where you want to run it.
2. Open a terminal in that directory.
3. Run the file in Python with the playlist link or ID as the argument. For example: `py .\youtubePlaylistUpdater.py {playlist link}`.
